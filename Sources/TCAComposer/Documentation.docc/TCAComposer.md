# ``TCAComposer``

TCA Composer is a swift macro framework for eliminating boiler-plate code in TCA-based applications. Composer provides a collection of swift macros that allow you to declaritively construct a `Reducer` and automaticaly generate all or portions of the `State`, `Action`, and `body` declarations. Composer can also automatically generate an entire `Reducer` for use in navigation destinations and stacks. While Composer is a powerful tool for eliminating boiler-plate code in TCA applications, it gives you complete control in customzing how to structure your code and application.
